# KushEats - Client Side

**Author**: Max Suman, Stephen Harper, Khalil Ahmed, Tim McCoy
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Accessing Yelp and Google Maps API's to dynamically pull information for Seattle marijuana dispenaries and nearby fast food restaurants near these locations. We are building it because we saw there is a need for both to populate on the map since they match well together. 

## Getting Started
To be able to build this app, the developer should have a computer. And have access to Google and Yelp API's. VS Code or Atom. Heroku for deployment.

## Architecture
The technologies we used are multiple. For languages, we used Javascript, CSS and HTML. For libraries, we used jQuery, page.js, express.js, yelp.fusion (Yelp API), Google Maps API, Cors, PostgreSQL. And we deployed our site on Heroku.
