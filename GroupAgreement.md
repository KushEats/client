# Group Agreement #

Communication plan: 
1. How will your group communicate with each other?
- We will speak to each other with respect and within the vicinity of each other, face-to-face when possible. And afterhours, use a group chat in Slack to bring up anything we feel is necessary. We will also let each one of us know what we are working on and what we are doing. 

2. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
- The strategy is to be attentive to what each of us wants to say. See if anyone has any input on anything. Run every step of what we do with each other. Perhaps one of us will have an idea that could help.

3. Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article on Google and teams from Class 14?
- Yes, the plan is to check in with everyone. See if there's any conflict. Be open to everyone's opinion. Focus on the work.

Conflict plan: 
1. What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
- We will approach whoever or whatever the conflict is and talk about it. See what it is we can do to help with the conflict. Generally, if it is something we cannot figure out, we will talk to a TA or instructor. 

2. What will your process be to resolve it?
- The process is to talk it out. Use empathy. Someone might feel like they're overwhelmed. Or doesn't know what they're doing. Or they're not finding the answer they are looking for. It's tough. But we'll get through it and help out. For the most part, we will be together and working on things where we see needs help. 

Work plan: 
1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
- We identify tasks via what we want in our MVP. And go down the list of what we want to do. Most of it will be based on what each of us want to tackle. If it isn't working, ask for help. Or ask if someone else wants to work on said task. For the most part, we will be mob-programming or pair-programming. 

Git process: 
1. What is your Git flow?
- Our git flow is to have a test branch that will be pulled into the master branch. Each of us will have a daily branch of tasks we will work ourselves or with others on each repo: the client and server side. Once in the master branch, Max will deploy the server side to Heroku since it is on his Heroku account.

2. How many people must review a PR?
- We will have one other review it. But even so, we will announce it out to the rest of the group what we are changing.

3. Who merges PRs?
- Same as above. At least two people will be looking at the pull request before merging but will be announced to the rest of the group.

4. Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
- We take breaks when we are feeling overwhelmed or stuck. Otherwise, we will be wasting time. Work times will try to be designated to 9am to 5pm or 6pm each day. Unless one of us wants to work more on a particular part. So long as they let us know.
For standups, each of us know what we want to tackle or try to tackle. It's in the MVP and we'll make adjustments from there.
